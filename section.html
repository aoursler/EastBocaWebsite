    We all know that families can be incredibly complex systems that can provide relief and support one day, and the worst kind of stress the next. Family relationship difficulties are very complicated and can prove distressing for all involved. Family relationship counselling requires particular expertise and training. Dr Justin Harrison has particular interest and expertise in couples and family counselling interventions, having worked with families for over a decade. So if your family life is getting to be more stress than support, it might be time to get that nudge in the right direction.
